**Disclaimer:** Trading Forex and other financial instruments with
leverage is risky and can lead to losing your invested money. You should
only invest money that you can afford to lose and make sure you
understand the risks involved. Leveraged trading might not be suitable
for everyone. Even trading non-leveraged products like stocks has risks
since stock values can go down as well as up, meaning you might get back
less than you invested. Past performance does not guarantee future
results. Before you start trading, think about your experience, and
investment goals, and consider seeking advice from a financial expert if
needed. It's your responsibility to check if using Quotex services is
allowed in your country.
